# Assessment of accuracy of AI-driven skin cancer classification in dark-skinned patients 

This repo containts the plan of action for our research project aiming to identify bias in machine learning algorithms for skin cancer detection

## Project background 

Scientists and organizations all over the world have recognized the potential Artificial Intelligence has to revolutionize Global Health.  With the right approach, the rise of AI-assisted technologies can improve the way we manage healthcare on a global scale, but efforts have to be made to ensure new technologies can be accessed by all, and take into account the participation and needs of diverse populations, not just the wealthy. 

The implementation of machine learning algorithms relies on data collection and analysis.   If the training data is misrepresentative of the variability present in the population, machine learning is prone to reinforcing inequality and bias. In healthcare, this could lead to dangerous outcomes, including misdiagnoses, missing diagnosis or poor treatment plans. 

There is previous evidence of the dangerous outcomes the replication of bias in machine learning algorithms used in healthcare can cause. One of those many examples comes from a  study published in Science, that demonstrated a software program that determines who gets access to high-risk health care management routinely lets healthier whites into the programs ahead of blacks who are less healthy. We have collected other examples of biased algorithms in the ["Health Data Sharin is Caring" repository](https://github.com/natalianorori/HealthDataSharingIsCarin) for you to explore. 

When it comes to dermatology,  artificial intelligence is being widely implemented to classify and diagnose skin lesions. A study published in Nature demonstrated that artificial intelligence is capable of classifying skin cancer with a level of competence comparable to dermatologists. Other studies employing similar algorithms reported the same. After widely analyzing some of the most popular open datasets used to train the algorithms in which these studies are based, we discovered the data predominantly contains images of lesions in caucasian skin. To avoid replicating existing bias, it is crucial to make sure the data collected reflects the diversity of existing populations.
 
To our knowledge, there are no studies that have tested the accuracy of ai-driven skin lesion classification technologies in dark-skinned patients. To quantify the problem, we are working on training a deep learning algorithm with caucasian skin samples and testing how it performs on darker skin.  Our end goal is to expand the ethnic variability of the dataset and compare how it performs against algorithms trained with imbalanced data. 

We hope our efforts serve as a guide to raise awareness of the underrepresentation of minorities in healthcare datasets, and the impact this can have on global health. We plan on publishing our outcomes and learnings in a research paper for others to build upon the results.  

## How to contribute 
This project is still in its early stages. We are currently studying existing technologies, collecting and analyzing data to develop the algorithm we will be using. If you are interested in contributing, get in touch with us.
